# Easiest Platformer

This project was my first experience ever using Unity or C#. I followed a tutorial which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii-scMenaOQ&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuCVTz6lvhR81nnaf1a-b67U&index=1). *Easiest Platformer* includes many basic game elements such as collectables, death logic, and UI/UX elements. 

I highly recommend trying to build a game with Unity if you haven't. It is really fun and rewarding!
